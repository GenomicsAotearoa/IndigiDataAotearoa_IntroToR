# Analysing genetic variant data in R

!!! info
    
    === "Keypoints"
    
        - R can hold data as Objects and Functions can be used to ask questions of that data
        - The 1000 Genomes Project is a public resource for genetic data
        - SNPS (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) are small changes to our DNA that can be medically relevant

    === "Objectives"

        - Load publicly (freely) available data from The 1000 Genomes Project into R
        - 


## The data: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPS) from the 1000 Genomes Project

The data you will be working with today is publicly available high-throughput sequencing data from a resource called the 1000 genomes project.
